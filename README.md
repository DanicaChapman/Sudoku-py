# Sudoku-py
A simple game of sudoku coded in Python using the Pygame library

This is my first attempt at using Python for creating a game. The game uses the Pygame library and
depends on a "input" function that allows the user to input numbers into a randomly generated sudoku
grid. The grid is generated using a sudoku API and is set to a random level of difficulty. 

Hope you enjoy!
